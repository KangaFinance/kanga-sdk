# Kanga SDK

In-depth documentation on this SDK is available at [uniswap.org](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/SDK/getting-started/).

This modifies uniswap-sdk's UniswapV2Factory address. The new address for kanga on harmony-testnet is  `0xFc92cD6E5c40B8AdEd835bA9AD937B29255E9c14`.

**Note:** the latest address can be found [here](https://github.com/KangaFinance/kanga/blob/canary/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#harmony-testnet). If deploying new contracts then need to update [addresses.ts](./src/constants/addresses.ts).
